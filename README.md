    ```
- **Profile mode**:
    ```sh
    flutter run --profile
    ```
- **Release mode**:
    ```sh
    flutter run --release
    ```

---

## **Project Structure**

The project is organized as follows:

```
lib/
â”œâ”€â”€ logic/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ apis/          # Handles API interactions
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ models/        # Defines data models
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ repositories/  # Abstracts data handling
â”œâ”€â”€ ui/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ app/           # Main app setup, theming, and routing
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ bloc/          # Manages app state using BLoC pattern
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ modules/       # Screens and feature-specific widgets
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ widgets/       # Reusable UI components
â””â”€â”€ main.dart          # App entry point
```

### **Logic Components**
The `logic` directory contains:
- **APIs**: Manages network requests, e.g., `quiz_api.dart`.
- **Models**: Defines app data structures, e.g., `Quiz`, `Question`, and `Option`.
- **Repositories**: Abstracts data fetching and caching, e.g., `quiz_repository.dart`.

### **UI Components**
The `ui` directory contains:
- **App Setup**: Includes `app.dart`, `theme.dart`, and `routes.dart`.
- **BLoC Classes**: Manages app state, e.g., `quiz_data_bloc.dart`.
- **Modules**: Feature-specific screens and logic.
- **Widgets**: Reusable components for consistent UI.

---

## **Bootstrap and Entry Points**

### **1. `bootstrap` Function**
The `bootstrap` function is a utility that handles the initialization of the app. It ensures that the app is properly configured before rendering the UI.

#### **Responsibilities**
- Initializes Flutter bindings.
- Sets up global error handling using `FlutterError.onError`.
- Configures `Bloc.observer` for monitoring state changes.
- Initializes `HydratedBloc` storage for persistent state management.
- Calls `runApp()` with the provided widget.

#### **Code**
```dart
Future<void> bootstrap(FutureOr<Widget> Function() builder) async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();

  FlutterError.onError = (details) {
    log(details.exceptionAsString(), stackTrace: details.stack);
  };

  Bloc.observer = FlutterBlocObserver();

  HydratedBloc.storage = await HydratedStorage.build(
    storageDirectory: kIsWeb
        ? HydratedStorageDirectory.web
        : HydratedStorageDirectory((await getTemporaryDirectory()).path),
  );
  runApp(await builder());
}
```

---

### **2. `main.dart`**
The `main.dart` file is the primary entry point for the app in **release mode**.

#### **Responsibilities**
- Defines the app's providers and dependencies.
- Wraps the app with `MultiBlocProvider` for state management.
- Passes the `App()` widget to the `bootstrap` function.

#### **Code**
```dart
void main() {
  bootstrap(() {
    final providers = [
      BlocProvider(create: (_) => AppTheme()),
      RepositoryProvider(create: (_) => QuizRepository()),
      BlocProvider(create: (_) => QuizDataManager(_.read<QuizRepository>())),
      BlocProvider(create: (_) => QuizHistoryManager()),
    ];

    return MultiBlocProvider(
      providers: providers,
      child: App(),
    );
  });
}
```

---

### **3. `main_debug.dart`**
The `main_debug.dart` file is used as the entry point in **debug mode**. It is similar to `main.dart` but may include additional debugging tools and configurations.

#### **Responsibilities**
- Sets up debugging utilities such as `Flutter DevTools`.
- Provides mock dependencies or features for testing.
- Helps developers identify and fix issues during development.

#### **Example Usage**
In `main_debug.dart`, you might enable overlays or verbose logging for easier debugging.

## **How Logic and UI Are Separated**

![Flutter's recommended app architecture guide](.media/architecture.png)

This project adheres to [Flutter's recommended app architecture guide](https://docs.flutter.dev/app-architecture/guide), with slight modifications in folder naming to enhance clarity and maintainability. The structure ensures a clear separation of concerns:
### **Logic Layer (View-Model)**
  - Located in the `logic/` folder.
  - Manages API calls (`apis/`), defines data models (`models/`), and abstracts data handling through repositories (`repositories/`).
  
### **UI Layer**
  - Located in the `ui/` folder.
  - Includes app setup and routing (`app/`), state management using the BLoC pattern (`bloc/`), feature-specific screens (`modules/`), and reusable components (`widgets/`).

### **Benefits**
- **Clean Codebase**: Separation of concerns keeps the code organized and easy to navigate.
- **Testability**: Each layer can be independently tested for reliability.
- **Scalability**: Modular design supports easy extension and feature addition.

---

## **Testing (Work in Progress ðŸš§)**

To ensure the reliability and correctness of the application, we have included a comprehensive suite of tests. These tests cover various aspects of the app, including unit tests, widget tests, and integration tests.

### **Running Tests**

To run all tests, use the following command:
```sh
flutter test
```
### **Test Structure**

The tests are organized as follows:

```
test/
â”œâ”€â”€ unit/               # Unit tests for individual components
â”œâ”€â”€ widget/             # Widget tests for UI components
â””â”€â”€ integration/        # Integration tests for end-to-end scenarios
```

### **Writing Tests**

When writing tests, follow these guidelines:
- **Unit Tests**: Focus on testing individual functions or classes in isolation.
- **Widget Tests**: Verify the behavior and appearance of UI components.
- **Integration Tests**: Test the complete flow of the application, simulating user interactions.

---

## **Project Dependencies**

Quizzy relies on several dependencies to provide a robust and feature-rich experience. Below is a list of the key dependencies used in the project:

### **Core Dependencies**
- **flutter**: The core framework for building the app.
- **http**: For making network requests.
- **flutter_bloc**: For state management using the BLoC pattern.
- **hydrated_bloc**: For persisting BLoC state.
- **equatable**: For value equality in Dart objects.
- **path_provider**: For accessing the file system.
- **go_router**: For declarative routing.
- **confetti**: For adding confetti animations.

### **UI Dependencies**
- **cupertino_icons**: For iOS-style icons.
- **google_fonts**: For using Google Fonts in the app.

### **Development Dependencies**
- **flutter_test**: For writing tests.
- **flutter_lints**: For linting the codebase.
- **json_serializable**: For generating JSON serialization code.
- **build_runner**: For running code generation tasks.
- **bloc_test**: For testing BLoC components.
- **mockito**: For creating mock objects in tests.

### **Suite Dependencies**
- **bloc_suite**: A custom package for advanced BLoC utilities.
- **dart_suite**: A custom package for Dart utilities.

### **Future Dependencies**
- **fl_chart**: For creating beautiful charts and graphs (planned for future use).

By leveraging these dependencies, Quizzy ensures a clean, maintainable, and scalable codebase. Each dependency is carefully chosen to address specific needs and enhance the overall development experience.
